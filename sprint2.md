### 3. Not Testing
The following parts of the code haven't been tested:
| Component | Tested | Untested | Coverage | Testing Level |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Frontend Services | 0/6 | 6/6 | 0% | Not tested |
| Frontend Context | 1/3 | 1/3 | 33% | Mostly tested |

The frontend coverage report can be found in CarDex\CarDexFrontend\coverage\lcov-report\index.html

#### 5. Last Dash
 - We anticipate scope creep. As the application functions are getting bigger and complex than expected therefore we may not be able to complete all the targets that we aimed for at the start of the course.

 - The above commit is what I am most proud of. The thinking and brainstorming of how I could do this was interesting, frustrating and exciting to see it work.  I learnt so much about frontend as I have not worked this deeply in frontend before so I wasn’t an expert but understanding why we need some of these code files and techniques was interesting to learn and understand.
